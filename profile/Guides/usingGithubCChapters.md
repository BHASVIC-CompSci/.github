## Using Github for the C Chapters

### What this is for
Use this guide to help get used to github for the first time when doing your C Chapter work.

Please make sure to read through the other sections of the guide to understand Github better too.

### Setting up Github for C First Time - New Folder without Existing Files
1. [Create your repository](makingRepo.md) on the github website **making sure to select C in the [.gitignore](gitignore.md) field** and also **making sure you name it appropriately**
1. [Clone](cloning.md) the repository using github desktop, save it somewhere in your user directory into a **new folder** e.g. `C:\Users\Ben\Computer Science\C Chapters`, this doesn't need to be named the same name as your repository
1. Copy and paste all your C projects into your new folder. You do this by copying the entire project folder containing all files generated by you and CLion (e.g. your c files, CMakeLists.txt). Use file explorer to do this. You'll know if this has worked as you'll see a big list of changes in github desktop.
1. [Commit and push](pushing.md) it at the end of the lesson
