## Pulling

### What this is for
If you've made changes on a different computer you'll want to pull those changes so you get a copy on your current machine. This means you'll be working on the most up to date version of your code.

### What to do
1. Open github desktop and select the repository you're working on from the top left
2. It'll say "pull" at the top where you previously pushed your code, click this
3. Wait for it to download and then start working
