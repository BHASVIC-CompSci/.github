# Renaming reposotories on github

## Why do you need to rename a repository?

There are many reasons why you might want to rename a repository. For example, you might want to change the name of a repository if you spelled the name wrong when you created the repository or if you have a repository with a generic name, like "test" or "blog", and you want to make the purpose of the repository clearer. You will need to add your username at the start of the repository so that it is searchable.

## How to rename a repository

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Under your repository name, click Settings.
3. Under "Repository name", type the new name of the repository.
4. Click Rename.
