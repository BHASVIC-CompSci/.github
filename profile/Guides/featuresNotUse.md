## Features not used
Github offers a wide range of features and many of these are targetted towards programming in a team for a wide organisation.

Whilst learning it new and as a solo programmer there are a range of tools we recommend you **don't** use at this stage.

You may see these mentioned on tutorials online but feel free to ignore them at this stage. If you do want to investigate and play around with them you're welcome to but we might not be able to help if things go wrong.

These are
- Branching
- Merging
- Pull requests
- Github actions
- Large file storage
- Issues
- Code spaces
