## Cloning

### What this is for
Cloning gives you a copy of your repository on the computer you're using. You'll use it the first time you download your project on a new machine in college or at home.

Once you've cloned for the first time you don't need to do so again on the same device. When you want to get the latest version next time you pull instead.

### What to do
1. Open the github site and navigate to the repository you've created in our organisation
2. Click the green code<> button and then "open with github desktop", your browser might ask you if it's ok to open it first
3. Follow the prompt in github desktop - make sure to pick an appropriate folder within your user documents so it's stored within your windows account and not accessible to others using the PC. 
This needs to be your user folder on the harddrive e.g. `C:\Users\Ben\Computer Science\GitHub`. To avoid issues you must **not use OneDrive**.
