## Pushing to github

### What does pushing mean?
Pushing is uploading your recent work (also called commits) to github so it's centrally stored and can be accessed from other computers. 

This also adds your code as previous version you can read to see your past work.

This can be done when you're finished working and want to carry on at another computer, or just when you've done a significant piece of work you'd like to create a version of.

### How do I push?
1. Open github desktop and select the repository you're working on from the top left
2. You'll see all your changes on the screen, with all the files that are going to be pushed on the left hand side
3. Fill in the commit box on the left hand side with sensible summary and description, you'll be relying on it later. Then click commit
4. Press push on the right hand side of the bar at the top
