# Making a Repository

## What is a Repository?

A repository is a place where you can store your code. It is a folder that contains all of your code and files. You can create a repository on your computer, or you can create one on GitHub. If you create a repository on GitHub, you can then clone it to your computer. Cloning a repository means that you are copying the repository from GitHub to your computer. You can then make changes to the repository on your computer and push those changes to GitHub.

## Creating a Repository on GitHub

To create a repository in the BHASVIC organization, you can create a repository by clicking on the green "New" button on the [BHASVIC organization reposoitory page](https://github.com/orgs/BHASVIC-CompSci/repositories). The repository name should be the your username followed by the name of your project. EG
