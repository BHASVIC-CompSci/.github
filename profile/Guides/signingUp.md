## Signing Up

### What this is for
To use github you'll need to create an account using your bhasvic email and join our organisation. This means your work is shared with your teacher and technicians can help support any issues.

### What to do
#### Creating your account
Watch the following video and make sure to follow it carefully. Skipping a step can make everything go wrong. You'll need to have been sent an invite first, don't try to set up before your teacher has told you to do so.

Make sure your username is in the correct format of BHASVIC-*your username* e.g. `BHASVIC-VincentVanGogh22`

#### Installing github desktop
We'll be using github desktop while in college, whilst you can integrate it with a range of IDEs we request you use github desktop and that's the software we'll support you with.

If you'll be using it on your own device download and install it from here -> https://desktop.github.com/
