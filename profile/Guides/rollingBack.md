## Rolling Back

### What this is for
If you want to access a previous version of your code you can get access to any previous commit you've done. This can then be pulled and work on on your computer.

### What to do
1. Open the repository on github desktop
2. Click on where it says "commits", there'll be a number before it showing how many you have
3. Click the <> button on the right hand side and you'll see the repository
4. Pull it as normal
