## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the BHASVIC computer science org, remember to sign in to view your files :D

> WIP document, this will be continually added to over the next few weeks

#### Getting started

Here is information for you on how to use Github in college. Please **read the information below carefully** as it may differ from what you've done before. Following this is important to make sure we can maintain your accounts.

#### Username / Repository names

##### Username
Please make sure your username fits the pattern of 'BHASVIC-{CollegeUsername}, EG: BHASVIC-JonathanAnderson21 (Write your username in without the dot). We need this written exactly in this format so check it carefully. If you need to change it you can find the change username button here: https://github.com/settings/admin

##### Naming repositories

Firstly make sure you are making the repository inside the BHASVIC org and not on your personal profile. This means your teacher will be able to access it without you having to invite them individually and you can easily invite team members to work with. You can find a direct link to do that here:
https://github.com/organizations/BHASVIC-CompSci/repositories/new


Each repository needs to follow the pattern of '{CollegeUsername}-{What the repository is for}, EG: "bsanders-CChapters" (Write your username in without the dot). Repositories must have your username written beforehand for our system to recognise them. Please make sure that **repository names are sensible** to help you and us identify what they're for (not "Code" or "andjksadjsakjd").

#### Tutorials
You can view the full github documentation [here](https://docs.github.com/en) for tutorials on how to get started, and can find the Hello World project [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world).

 Don't worry about getting too in depth with things like branches and merges at the start, as long as you know how to create repositories and use them locally. The easiest way to do this is with [Github Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop).
