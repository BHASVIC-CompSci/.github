## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the BHASVIC computer science org, remember to sign in to view your files :D

> WIP document, this will be continually added to over the next few weeks

#### Getting started

Please make sure your username fits the pattern of 'BHASVIC-{CollegeUsername}, EG: BHASVIC-JonathanAnderson21 (Write your username in without the dot). This just makes it easier to find people. If you need to change it you can find the change username button here: https://github.com/settings/admin

#### Tutorials
You can view the full github documentation [here](https://docs.github.com/en) for tutorials on how to get started, and can find the Hello World project [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world).

 Don't worry about getting too in depth with things like branches and merges at the start, as long as you know how to create repositories and use them locally. The easiest way to do this is with [Github Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop).

#### Naming repositories

Ideally repository names should explain what the project is and who made it. `Jonathan's Random Cat Generator` is better than `Homework3`. Adding either your full name or your team name will also make it easier for you teacher to easily find it,
