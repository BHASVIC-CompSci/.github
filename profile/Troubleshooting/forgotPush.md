## Forgot to push
If you forget to push before working elsewhere (e.g. you work at home, forget to commit then continue working at college) you'll have the issue that there are now two versions of your work.

This can cause issues as when you try commit your work the two versions could have changed the same files.

### What to do
Ideally work on different files until you can commit your original code. For example if working in greenfoot and at home you worked largely on the world just work on actors in college. This means when you commit both there shouldn't be any clashes and it will merge them together for you.

If you can't do this when you commit github will raise a clash as an error. It will merge your code as well as it can for you and ask you to decide if say the same line was changed in two places.

If this happens and you need support read [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github) or contact us on the githelp help channel on Teams.
