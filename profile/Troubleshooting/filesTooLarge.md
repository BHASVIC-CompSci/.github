## Files too large to push
If you get an error saying files are too large to push this means something odd has happened, we have large file storage enabled.

If you get this error try the tips below

### What to do
- Check your .gitignore is set up, if not it may be trying to upload big unity files that aren't needed. See the guide on here for help, you can add it retroactively to an existing project
- Your project might have a specific need for really large files that are difficult to store. If you think this is the case speak to your teacher
- Other issues please post on the Teams github help channel so we can see it as it's likely a particular issue with your project
