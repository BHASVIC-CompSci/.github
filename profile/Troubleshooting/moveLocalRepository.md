## Cloned to the wrong folder / need to move repository
If you have accidentally cloned to the wrong folder, say not your user documents or to one drive, you'll need to move it to the appropriate place.

### Transferring to your college account
1. Find the folder your repository is stored in, on github desktop there's an option you can click to immediately show this
2. Copy and paste the entire folder to a new location
3. Check github desktop, if it's worked it'll not show any changes and will work as it did before
