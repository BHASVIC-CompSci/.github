## Project already on personal account
You may have already stored some work on a personal github account. College work needs to be on your college account so it can be managed by your teachers and technicians.

If you have anything on your personal account then you'll want to transfer it over.

### Transferring to your college account
1. Clone the repository from your personal account to the computer you're working on
2. Make a new repository with your BHASVIC account
3. Add the files from your project into your new repository, just copy and paste the files into the folder it's stored in
4. Commit the files and they'll now be on your BHASVIC account
